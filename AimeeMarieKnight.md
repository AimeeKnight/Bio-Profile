I'm passionately curious about emerging technology, while consistently focused on fundamental principles. As a former professional figure skater, I'm extremely driven, holding myself and the software I write to the highest standards. I enjoy staying active in the JavaScript community through speaking at conferences, podcasting, blogging at [AimeeMarieKnight.com](http://aimeemarieknight.com/)and helping to organize meetups and conferences.

While much of the code I write for my employer is private, my open source software projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/aimeeknight).
